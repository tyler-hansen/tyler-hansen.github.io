#### Current
I'm a 6th year PhD Candidate in Dr. Emily Hodges Lab at Vanderbilt University. In the Hodges' Lab, I develop and apply functional genomic technologies to understand gene regulatory evolution of humans. During the first several years of my PhD, I developed the __ATAC-STARR-seq__ method, which provides genome-wide measures of regulatory activity, chromatin accessibility, and TF binding at human gene regulatory elements. After developing ATAC-STARR-seq, I spent the second half of my PhD applying it to investigate _cis_ and _trans_ effects on human gene regulatory evolution in collaboration with Dr. Tony Capra's Lab at UCSF. I am currently wrapping up this project and have begun looking for Postdoctoral Fellowship opportunities. I'm interested in the gene regulatory evolution of human immune responses to pathogens. I have skills in both wet/dry lab techniques that allow me to both generate and analyze functional genomic data. 

#### Previous 
I majored in Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and worked as an undergraduate researcher for 3 years in Dr. Judith Kimble's lab. There I studied the molecular processes that dictate stem cell self-renewal and differentiation decisions in the _C. elegans_ germline. After graduating from Undergrad in 2015, I worked as postbac in Dr. Andy Golden's lab for two years at the National Institutes of Health, where I used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate molecular models of rare human monogenic diseases in C. elegans for purposes of elucidating unknown disease mechanisms and developing potential drug treatments.
