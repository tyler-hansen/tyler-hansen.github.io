I am a Senior Grad Student in Dr. Emily Hodges Lab at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. I developed a novel functional genomic assay called ATAC-STARR-seq, which quantifies regulatory activity of accessible chromatin. My current study uses this method to investigate gene regulatory mechanisms of human evolution. Outside of science, I enjoy spending time with my family! I love going on hikes and here I am pictured with Henry at Glacier National Park!
